# My expectations for Scarlett's primary school education

Maybe I should start from my concerns, since I always subconciously focus on what we lack, and then we can work my way up to how best to address them.

1. Interpersonal skills: Scarlett is quite cautious with others, may be a bit towards withdrawl side. She is most comfortable playing by herself, and sometimes resist being pushed to play with others by saying "I'm enjoying my lonely soul" or "I'm humming my lonely song." I believe that she is an introvert and therefore gains energy from a calm environment, but I have also observed times when she enjoys being close to a busy scene but not participating in it, so it could be that she lacks the confidence and techniques to join others. Also, she is a sensitive child, taking refusal/rejection to heart, noticing her difference from others (e.g. I'm the only one speaking Chinese, Anian and I have black hair), and not yet understanding that others do not know what she knows or how she feels unless she explicitly expresses it. Therefore, an inclusive school with diversity may suit her better?
